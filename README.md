# DesktopAssistant

This is a desktop assistant project that provides two features:
- Voice Assistant
- Opening multiple desktop applications in one click
- Play music from local folders

Voice assistant features interacts with the user to provide responses to the requests user raises. This may include news, jokes, music, wikipedia information about a famous personality etc.,

When user runs app for the first time, the program asks for location of music files and app executables in the filesystem. These get stored at "C://Desktop Assistant/" folder, so that the app can use from next time onwards.
Here are some screenshots of the app asking for those locations:

After the user gives the file locations once, running the app from next time will not prompt for those locations and the main UI gets displayed.
